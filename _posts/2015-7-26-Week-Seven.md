We finally “shipped” the website, and got to see everyone’s presentations about their own work. It’s rather spooky to think back to the first phase and realize how much work we got done in such a small number of weeks. Some of the features that other groups implemented were pretty amazing. After the exhilaration of getting the final phase of the project out the door, studying for the second exam is a bit of a letdown. Learning so much, so fast through the project makes “regular” studying for an exam seem dull in comparison.

Overall, I’m rather impressed with this class. I found all of the projects engaging, and the three-phase website project teaches you a hell of a lot of information on some difficult topics. For a lot of this material, there’s no other way to learn except to jump in and start making things (or trying to make things). 

Here’s some advice for anyone who finds this blog and has a chance to take this class:

1. I strongly recommend that you do take the class.
2. Don’t just blow off studying for the daily quizzes. Actually prepare for them, as they can be trickier than you expect.
3. Read Piazza and show up to class if you’re afraid of getting called on.
4. Talk to people before it’s time to find a group for the IDB project. I was lucky enough to really like my group, but you spend so much time together that finding people you enjoy working with makes a big difference.
5. Check for existing solutions for everything in the IDB project. Everything. You'd be surprised how much time you can save, or conversely how much time implementing something from scratch can take.

Now to refocus my attention on the incredibly fast-paced five-week Programming Languages class and its ever-present homework...

**Tip of the week**

Useful Tool - [Swiftype](https://swiftype.com/)

Although we did not use Swiftype, other groups did and the results were impressive. After seeing how much work implementing our search took, I will check out Swiftype if/when I need to add search to a website.
