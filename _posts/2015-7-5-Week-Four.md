title: Week Four

My theme for this week is the importance of reading the instructions. Reading the instructions, whether on a project or on an exam, is crucial both for what the instructions say and for what they do not say. For example, if exam instructions explicitly list some things that you cannot use in your answer, you can probably assume that anything not explicitly listed is fair game. This concept is what allows for the incredibly efficient one-line answers that were possible for some of the exam questions. Although my answers worked, they were rather long. The efficiency of the possible one-line answers is very appealing.

Apart from exams, reading the instructions is also important on projects. For our current project, I feel like we’re constantly balancing what would be ideal or a best practice against how much time we have before we have to ship aka turn in this phase of the project. The instructions for Phase 1 are very clear about what is required for this phase, and therefore we can get a better understanding of what is not required for this phase. I really like the middle ground we’ve found, where we’re doing a lot more than the bare minimum but staying reasonable and planning out our phases.

I’ve been pondering the format of the exam. Writing out code by hand for functions that already exist certainly gets us to learn how those functions work, but the methodology seems slightly old-fashioned compared to other components of this course. Perhaps the intent is to prepare us for job interviews where we need to code on whiteboards under time pressure. 

**Tip of the week**

Powerful tables - [UI Grid](http://ui-grid.info/docs/#/tutorial/101_intro)

Brandon found these tables a few days ago, and I've spent the past few days getting them up and running for our project. Although the documentation can be somewhat sparse sometimes, the existing framework is quite powerful and accomplishes a lot of what we need to do with tables for this project. If you don't have a tables solution yet, I hightly recommend them.
