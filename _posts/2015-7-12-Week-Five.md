title: Week Five

This week’s main focus was delivering the first phase of the project and then working on the second phase. In addition to learning about the different tools and languages we’re using, we’re also learning about juggling all the different moving parts, working as a team, and more good things like those. The project continues to be more work than I was expecting, but seeing the website up and running felt pretty rewarding. I don’t remember another school project that provided a similar sense of accomplishment.

Some of the more recent readings have been a bit dry, honestly. I can appreciate the importance of the design principles being described, but the writing doesn’t compare to the excellently done Extreme Programming book. 

As we go out and learn about the tools we’re using for the project, I see more and more tools or projects that have either terrible or nonexistent documentation. Given how widely used some of these tools are, it’s a shame that so many top Google results are for Stack Overflow answers instead of official documentations or examples. All the more reason why it’s important for us to document our own work well, I suppose.

The pool of people that get called on during lecture seems to be shrinking, or at least stabilizing. I’m not sure if that’s because people have figured out how to make it less likely to get called on, or if the hidden metrics that determine the calling order are affected by the passage of time. Understanding the pattern more clearly does remove some of the attention-generating power of fear of getting called on, though.


**Tip of the week**

Best Practice - [ngRepeat](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngRepeat)

For anyone using AngularJS, here's an important tip that I learned. Lots of examples show ngRepeat in a div tag wrapped around the content you want to repeat. At least in my experience trying to repeat table rows within a table, you need to put the ngRepeat in the tr tag instead of a div wrapper. A small thing that might seem obvious to most, but not knowing it can cause some big headaches.
