title: Week Three

I really enjoyed Wednesday’s class visit from the Rackspace engineer. From a documentation perspective, I felt like the instructions he gave us were fairly simple and straightforward. But I also know that if he didn’t go through each step with us, plenty of people would have missed an important step or forgotten to do something. Again, I like that we’re using real tools to accomplish these projects. There’s a little bit less of the “Well, this is just for school, so…” mentality that sometimes pops up in other classes. 

Even more than the Rackspace instructions, I was fascinated by the portion of the talk focused on how to be successful as a software developer. Maybe the speaker was just that good an actor, but he seemed rather genuine. I had never considered the perspective that documenting your own project well makes it easier to hand off to someone else and go do the next cool thing. I’ve always continuously owned projects, but it makes sense that staying current in a career involves handing off older work to other people for maintenance. Plus I liked the honesty about different jobs caring about open source contributions or not. 

With the first part of the big three-part project already in flight, tomorrow’s exam almost feels like an afterthought. Like this pesky bookkeeping that we have to get out of the way so we can get back to the “real” work. Or maybe we need to have these concepts on lock in order to avoid heading down the wrong path with the project. Either way, back to studying.

**Tip of the week**

Useful app - [Serverauditor](https://serverauditor.com/)

I use Serverauditor to ssh into the CS lab machines from my iPhone and iPad. I've also used it to do some quick work on my Raspberry Pi when I don't feel like finding a full keyboard. I wouldn't recommend using Serverauditor for full development, but it's great for when you need to quickly check something or make a few small changes.
